            Obsidian Water Solutions is a Baton Rouge water treatment company. We are
            not a plumbing shop with a softener on the menu. We are not an AC company
            that tossed filtration on the truck. We test water, match equipment to what
            the test shows, install it cleanly, and answer the phone afterward. That is
            all we do.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            That focus matters here. Water around Baton Rouge is all over the map. City
            water comes from a deep aquifer. Private wells in Livingston and Ascension
            Parish run heavy with iron and sulfur. The right fix for one home is the
            wrong fix for the next. A company that sells one system sees one problem
            everywhere. A company built on testing can tell you the truth about your own
            tap.

              Professional-grade systems, one job per tank

            <p className="mt-7 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
              We install professional-grade equipment, sized and set up for your home
              instead of boxed for a shelf. The idea behind every system is simple. Each
              water problem gets its own media. Chlorine, hardness, iron, and sulfur
              each need a different material and different conditions. Ask one tank to do
              every job and it wears out early and works poorly.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
              So a well with iron and sulfur gets its own oxidation media first. A home
              with chlorine taste gets carbon sized to its flow rate. A tankless water
              heater gets a softener built to protect it. Your water test sets the
              combination, and the lifetime warranty covers what we install.
