City water reaches your Zachary tap carrying the chlorine added to clean it, the byproducts that come with it, and whatever grit the lines shed along the way.

Filling cups and school water bottles comes from the best tap in the house. It installs under the sink, and the free water test confirms what it is starting from.',

            The area typically has decent source water, but that is a starting point,
            not a guarantee of what reaches your glass. Between the treatment plant and
            your kitchen, the water picks up chlorine used to clean it, the byproducts
            that come with it, and grit from the lines. In an older home, the aging
            pipes add to it. None of that shows up in a clear glass. That is exactly
            why families here ask us to test before they decide.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            The sink is where it matters most. When the kids fill water bottles for
            school, parents want that tap to be the best water in the house. A reverse
            osmosis system under the kitchen sink delivers it: clean, crisp drinking
            water with no pantry full of plastic bottles. The chlorine taste that
            follows city water through the pipes is the complaint most people want
            gone, and a carbon filter takes it out at the tap or across the whole
            house.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            The other Zachary pattern is newer homes. Subdivisions like Americana
            filled up with recent builds and recent appliances. A filter plus a
            softener is how a tankless heater and a new dishwasher stay new. Hard-water
            minerals leave scale over years of hot-water cycles, so protecting a house
            full of new gear is more a when than an if. A free hardness test tells you
            where your home stands.

            Central and Baker get the same test-first treatment as Zachary. The rural
            parts of northern East Baton Rouge Parish also hold private wells, and well
            water is its own world: iron stains and a sulfur smell instead of chlorine
            taste. We treat wells across the region, and the deepest local write-up
            lives on our Walker page.
