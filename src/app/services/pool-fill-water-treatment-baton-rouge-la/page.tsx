const faqs = [
  {
    q: 'Why is my pool water brown?',
    a: 'Usually iron in the water that filled it. A pool concentrates whatever the fill water carries, because water evaporates and minerals stay behind. Chlorine then turns dissolved iron into rust, which stains plaster and can turn the whole pool a tea colour right after you shock it. Staining is generally reported from around 0.2 parts per million of iron, and private wells frequently run several times that. Testing the tap water is what tells you whether that is your cause.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I fill my pool through my water softener?',
    a: 'No. Softened water is the wrong water for a pool. The National Plasterers Council advises that fill water sit above 200 parts per million of calcium hardness, and that soft water or reverse osmosis water be bypassed when filling. Water low in calcium pulls calcium out of the plaster itself, which can cause discolouration, a weakened cement binder and a shorter service life for the finish. Filling an entire pool through a residential softener will also exhaust the resin bed. If your hose bib or autofill line sits on the treated side of a softener, it should be moved or bypassed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you remove iron from my water without softening it?',
    a: 'Yes, and that is the right approach for a pool home. Oxidising filter media handle iron, manganese and sulfur while leaving calcium hardness alone. That matters here because the softener that solves scale in the house is the wrong thing on a pool fill line. The two jobs need different equipment, which is why we test before recommending anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you clean pools or sell pool chemicals?',
    a: 'No. We do not service pools, remove existing stains, or sell chemicals. We work on the water supply feeding the pool. If your pool already has staining, a pool professional handles the surface, and we deal with the source so it does not come back. Your pool store will test your pool water for free. What generally goes untested is the water going into it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is Baton Rouge tap water hard or soft for a pool?',
    a: 'The Baton Rouge area draws from the deep Southern Hills aquifer, which the USGS describes as primarily soft sodium bicarbonate water. For a house that is good news. For a pool it is worth measuring, because water low in calcium is the kind that can go looking for calcium in the plaster. Published figures vary and most of the ones claiming the water is hard come from companies selling softeners, so we would rather measure yours than quote a number at you.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does the test cost?',
    a: 'The in-home water test is free and there is no obligation to buy. We test the tap water that fills the pool and can look at a pool sample alongside it for comparison. If your water does not need treatment we will tell you that.',

            Water evaporates. Minerals and metals do not. Every top-off adds a little
            more of whatever your tap carries, and none of it leaves. A pool on
            iron-bearing water slowly becomes an iron concentrator, which is why the
            staining tends to get worse each season rather than better.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            Testing the fill water is standard practice in the pool trade, not a
            novelty. It is simply a step most homeowners never get to, because the
            free testing offered at a pool store is testing the pool, not the tap.

          <p className="mt-7 text-lg leading-relaxed text-zinc-300">
            This is the part most people selling water equipment leave out. A softener
            is the right answer for scale inside your house. It is the wrong water for
            a pool.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-300">
            The National Plasterers Council advises that pool fill water sit above 200
            parts per million of calcium hardness, and that soft water and reverse
            osmosis water be bypassed when filling. Water that low in calcium does not
            stay low for long. It pulls calcium out of the plaster instead, and the
            damage ranges from discolouration to a weakened cement binder and a
            shorter service life for the finish.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-300">
            So the first thing worth checking in a pool home is plumbing, not
            equipment: whether the hose bib or autofill line sits on the treated side
            of the softener. If it does, it should be moved or bypassed. That costs
            you a plumbing change, not a system.

                The Baton Rouge area draws from the deep Southern Hills aquifer, which

                water is easy on a house. On a pool it is worth measuring, because
                water low in calcium is exactly the kind that goes looking for calcium
                in the plaster. That is a reason to test before you fill, not a reason
                to panic.

                Wells across Livingston and Ascension Parish commonly carry iron,

                filtration that handles it removes iron and manganese without stripping
                the calcium the plaster needs.
