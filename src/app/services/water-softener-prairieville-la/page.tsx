    q: 'My new build has a softener loop. What is that?',
    a: 'A softener loop is a short piece of pipe the builder roughed in, usually in the garage. It lets a water softener connect without cutting into your plumbing later. It is the cheapest, cleanest spot you will ever have to install one. Hooking a softener to a loop is usually a quick single visit, and installation is free with the system.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do tankless water heaters really need a softener?',
    a: 'Scale is the main enemy of a tankless water heater. Every time water runs through it, minerals bake onto the heat exchanger. Many Prairieville new builds come with a tankless unit standard. A softener stops that scale from forming in the first place, instead of cleaning it out after the damage is done. It protects your dishwasher, fixtures, and glass shower doors the same way.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does a water softener cost in Prairieville?',
    a: 'The Complete Home Package pairs a softener with drinking-water filtration for $4,599 installed. Package pricing can save up to 40% versus buying each system on its own. A softener by itself costs less. We quote from your free in-home water test, so it is sized to how hard your water really is, and installation is free either way.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is installation different for new construction versus an older home?',
    a: 'Only the plumbing part changes. A new build with a softener loop is the fastest install we do, because the connection point is already there. In an older Prairieville home we tie into the main line, which is routine work we do in the same visit. Installation is free with the system either way, and we walk you through the settings and salt before we leave.',

            Prairieville has grown faster than almost anywhere in the metro. Drive the
            new streets off Highway 42 and Highway 73 and you see it: subdivision after
            subdivision of new homes. Most come with a tankless water heater and a
            softener loop. Builders rough in the loop because they know the softener
            belongs there. They just leave the softener itself to you.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            That makes the choice easy for a new homeowner. Your most expensive
            appliances, the tankless heater, the dishwasher, the washer, are all brand
            new today. Scale is what wears them out. A softener on the loop means those
            appliances only ever see soft water. You are not fixing a problem later.
            You are stopping it in the first month, when protection is worth the most.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            Water in Ascension Parish is a mixed bag. Most Prairieville subdivisions
            run on community systems like Parish Utilities. Homes near the parish edges
            and older acreage lots can be on private wells, where iron shows up too.
            The free in-home test measures how hard your water is and checks for iron
            before we suggest anything. That way the system fits your address, not an
            average.
