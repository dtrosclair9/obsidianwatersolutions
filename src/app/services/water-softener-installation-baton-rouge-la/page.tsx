    a: 'If any of these sound familiar, hard water is already at work. Your dishes come out spotted. Your faucets wear a white crust. Soap and shampoo will not lather. Your skin feels filmy after a shower. These are the signs people call us about most. Hard water also builds up inside a tankless water heater, the appliance most at risk. Every home is different, so the only way to know your number is to measure it. The free in-home test does that at your own tap.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does a water softener cost installed?',
    a: 'The price depends on how hard your water is and how big your home is. That is why the free water test comes before any quote. Our best value is the Complete Home Package at $4,599 installed. It pairs a softener with a chlorine filter and can save you up to 40% versus buying the pieces apart. Installation is free with every system either way.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why do tankless water heaters need soft water?',
    a: 'Hard water leaves buildup on the part that heats the water, and that part is the whole heater. Builders put tankless heaters in almost every new home around here. Most makers call for softening to keep the unit running right. A softener stops the buildup before it reaches the heater. That is the biggest local reason to install one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much salt will a softener use?',
    a: 'That depends on how hard your water really is, which is one more reason to test first. We set the system to clean itself based on how much water you use, not a fixed timer. So it only runs when it needs to. That keeps both salt and water use low for a system sized the right way.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does installation take?',
    a: 'Most softeners go in on a single visit, and homes with a softener loop go even faster. We set the schedule when we quote the system. Installation is free, and we program the system to your test results before we leave.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between a softener and a salt-free conditioner?',
    a: 'A softener pulls the hard minerals out of your water. A conditioner leaves them in but changes them so they build up less. Only a true softener gives you truly soft water: the slick rinse, better soap, and spot-free glasses. A conditioner suits homes that want less buildup without using salt. We install both and recommend whichever your test and your goals call for.',

            Hard water is minerals you cannot see in the glass. Those minerals do
            not stay in the water. They build up as a chalky crust on everything the
            water touches. They also change how your water feels on your skin and
            how it works with soap. Every home is different, so the only way to know
            your water is to test it. Here is what those minerals do while you are
            not looking.

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
                Builders put tankless water heaters in almost every new home around
                here. These heaters have one big enemy: buildup from hard water. A
                little collects on the part that heats the water every time you run
                hot water. Over time it makes the heater work harder and wear out
                early. This is the most expensive part of your plumbing to replace. A
                softener stops the buildup before it ever reaches the heater.

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
                White spots on your glasses. Chalky crust on faucets and shower
                heads. Film on your tile, and soap that will not lather. That is all
                hard water leaving its mark. These are the problems people call us
                about most. They show up long before anyone thinks to test the water.
                If your home is doing this, your water is trying to tell you
                something. Test it and find out.

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
                Hard water and soap mix into a film that clings to your skin. It
                dulls your hair and turns white laundry gray over time. A lot of
                people blame their soap or shampoo. The real problem is usually the
                water. A softener changes that. Soap works the way it should, colors
                stay bright, and your skin stops feeling filmy after a shower.

              Our most popular setup does two jobs in one tank. It softens your
              water and filters out the chlorine taste at the same time. So you get

              our Complete Home Package at $4,599 installed. Buying the pieces apart
              costs more, so the package can save you up to 40%, and installation is

            Many new homes across Ascension Parish come with a softener loop. That
            is a spare hookup in the garage, built for a water softener. Most owners
            never learn what it is for. It means your home was ready for a softener
            from day one. The tankless heater on the wall next to it is the reason
            why. And it makes the install about as quick and clean as it gets. If
            you just closed on a new build, this is the easiest upgrade in the house.
