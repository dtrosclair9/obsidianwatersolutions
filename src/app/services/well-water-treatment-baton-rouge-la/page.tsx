const faqs = [
  {
    q: 'Why does my well water smell like rotten eggs?',
    a: 'That rotten-egg smell is sulfur gas, and it is one of the most common well water complaints in Livingston and Ascension Parish. It forms naturally underground and escapes the moment you open a tap. That is why the smell hits hardest in a hot shower. A dedicated sulfur filter traps the gas before it reaches your plumbing, so the odor is gone at every faucet.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What causes orange or brown stains on my tubs and laundry?',
    a: 'Those orange and brown stains are iron in your well water, turning to rust when it meets the air. Even in small amounts, iron stains fixtures, dulls laundry, and leaves rings in toilets. Iron is the most common well water problem in our area. The right iron filter removes it before it ever reaches a fixture.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does a well water treatment system cost in the Baton Rouge area?',
    a: 'We quote well systems from your actual water test, not a flat menu. A little iron and a lot of iron need different gear. Installation is free with your system. And package pricing can save you up to 40% when you combine well treatment with a softener or a drinking-water filter. The free test comes first, so the quote fits what your well really needs.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will a regular water softener fix iron and sulfur?',
    a: 'Not reliably, and this is the most expensive mistake well owners make. A softener can catch a trace of iron. But real iron or any sulfur will clog up a softener and leave the real problem untreated. Wells with iron or sulfur need a dedicated filter ahead of any softener. That is exactly what our two-tank well systems do.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I know what is actually in my well water?',
    a: 'Test it, because no one checks a private well but the owner. Our free in-home test covers iron, how hard the water is, pH, dissolved solids, and sulfur. We explain the results on the spot. A well can also change over time, so it is worth retesting every couple of years, even after treatment.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you service wells outside Baton Rouge?',
    a: 'Yes. Most of the wells we treat are outside the city, across Livingston Parish around Walker, Watson, and Holden, and through Ascension Parish around Prairieville, St. Amant, and Geismar. If you are anywhere in the greater Baton Rouge area, you are in our service area.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is well water with iron or sulfur dangerous to drink?',
    a: 'Iron and sulfur at the levels typical in local wells mostly affect taste, smell, and staining, not your health. Still, a well that has changed color or smell deserves a full test. The same conditions can come with other issues, like bacteria, that do matter for health. So treat the nuisance, but check the safety.',

                That smell is sulfur gas, dissolved in the water deep underground. It
                escapes the moment the water hits the air. Hot water makes it worse,
                which is why the shower is where most people finally decide to fix it.
                The right filter removes it for good.

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
                That is iron in your water, turning to rust when it meets the air. It
                shows up as rust rings, orange streaks under faucets, and dingy whites
                from the wash. An iron filter traps it in the tank instead of on your
                fixtures.

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
                This is usually manganese, iron&apos;s lesser-known cousin. It is
                common in the same Livingston and Ascension Parish groundwater. It
                stains darker than iron. We treat it the same way, as long as the
                system is sized for it from the start.

                This is sand and silt pulled up from underground. It wears out your
                fixtures, clogs faucet screens, and shortens the life of your pump. A
                grit filter ahead of the main tanks catches it first.
