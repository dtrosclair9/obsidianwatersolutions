    a: 'Yes, completely free and with no obligation attached. The visit costs you nothing whether you buy a system or never call us again. Testing is how we build honest quotes, because sizing equipment without a water test is guessing, and we would rather earn the install with a number you watched us measure at your own tap.',

    q: 'How long does the water test take?',
    a: 'It is a short visit, not an evening. We test at your tap, walk you through each result as it develops, and answer whatever questions come up. There is no presentation, no projector, and no pressure to buy anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What do you test for?',
    a: 'Hardness, iron, chlorine, total dissolved solids, and pH, measured right at your faucet. Together those five readings tell the story of your water: whether scale is building in your tankless heater, whether chlorine is what you are tasting, whether iron explains the staining, and how your water compares to what a treatment system would deliver.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a water test if I am on city water?',
    a: 'It depends on what you want to know. Baton Rouge city water is genuinely good, so the test is less about safety and more about specifics: your actual chlorine level, whether your neighborhood runs harder than the aquifer average, and a baseline TDS number before you invest in drinking water equipment. If the results say you need nothing, that is exactly what we will tell you.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How often should well owners retest their water?',
    a: 'Every couple of years, even when everything seems fine. A private well has no utility watching it, and groundwater changes: iron and sulfur levels can drift, and a new smell or stain is always worth a fresh test rather than a guess. Retesting is free too, so there is no reason to wonder.',

                The mineral content that scales tankless water heaters, spots
                glassware, and fights your soap. Baton Rouge aquifer water runs
                naturally low, but your neighborhood, and especially your well, may
                read differently. This number decides whether a softener is worth
                discussing at all.

                most common complaint from well homes in Livingston and Ascension
                Parish. Even trace levels leave evidence, and the test tells us
                whether iron treatment belongs in the conversation.

                The disinfectant your utility adds to keep water safe in the lines.
                It is supposed to be there, and it is also the taste and smell most
                city water households want gone. We measure what actually reaches

                A single number summarizing everything dissolved in your water. It

            City water arrives pre-treated and monitored by a utility, so testing it
            is about taste, chlorine, and baseline numbers before an upgrade. A
            private well has no utility behind it: the owner is the water system,
            and nobody is watching iron, sulfur, or sediment unless the owner has it
            tested. If your home is on a well around Walker, Watson, Holden,
            Prairieville, or St. Amant, the free test leans harder on iron and
            sulfur indicators, because those are the problems local groundwater
            actually serves up.
