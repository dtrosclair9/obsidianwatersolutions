    a: 'You test it. Plenty of Gonzales homeowners wonder what is really in their tap water. The honest answer is that you cannot know by looking, guessing, or reading a utility-wide report. Chlorine from cleaning the water, the byproducts it leaves, grit from the lines, how hard the water is, and whatever the pipes in an older home add are all invisible in a clear glass. We do not guess, we test, right at your faucet and for free. On a private well, the test also checks for the iron and manganese that show up across the parish.',

  {
    q: 'What about iron in Ascension Parish wells?',
    a: 'Iron is the known, recurring problem in local well water. USGS studies of Ascension Parish groundwater flag iron and manganese as the standout concerns in the Norco aquifer, which feeds hundreds of home wells across the parish. If your home is on a well and you see orange stains in tubs and toilets or dark streaks in laundry, that is the pattern. It is treatable with the right gear, sized to your test numbers.',

    q: 'What does water filtration cost in Gonzales?',
    a: 'The Complete Home Package is $4,599 installed, and package pricing can save up to 40% versus buying each system on its own. Single systems cost less. A well home usually needs different gear than a home on city water. The free in-home water test comes first, so the quote matches what is really in your water, and installation is free either way.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you cover St. Amant and Geismar too?',
    a: 'Yes. Gonzales, St. Amant, Geismar, and the roads between them are all regular service area. That stretch includes plenty of the well homes where iron treatment matters most. The free water test travels anywhere in Ascension Parish at no charge.',

            Ask two neighbors in Gonzales about their water and you can get two
            different answers. They may literally have different water. Depending on
            the address, homes here run on the city&apos;s own utility or on the parish
            system, each with its own wells and treatment. Ride out toward St. Amant or
            the acreage past the interstate and a third kind shows up: private wells
            pulling straight from the ground.

            Plenty of Gonzales families wonder what is really coming out of their tap.
            It is a fair question, and no one can settle it by looking or guessing.
            City water still reaches your home carrying the chlorine used to clean it,
            the byproducts that come with it, grit from the lines, and whatever the
            pipes in an older home add. None of that shows up in a clear glass. We do
            not guess, we test. A reading at your own faucet trades the rumor for a
            real number.

          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            The wells are a different story. USGS studies of Ascension Parish
            groundwater flag iron and manganese as the main concerns in the Norco
            aquifer, which feeds hundreds of home wells across the parish. Well homes
            around Gonzales see it as orange tub rings and stained laundry. That needs
            real treatment gear, not a pitcher filter. Either way, the free test tells
            you which water you have before you spend a dollar.
