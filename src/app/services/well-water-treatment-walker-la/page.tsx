    a: 'The shallow aquifers under Livingston Parish run high in dissolved iron and manganese. USGS groundwater studies of the parish have documented that pattern. Wells around Walker, Watson, and Holden draw from exactly that water. That is why orange staining shows up in almost every well home here that has no filter. It is a geology problem, and it has an equipment fix.',

    q: 'Do you actually come out to Walker, or just Baton Rouge?',
    a: 'Walker and the well belt around it are core service area for us, not an afterthought. Most of the wells we treat are in Livingston Parish. The drive from Baton Rouge is part of every well quote at no charge, and so is the free in-home water test.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My neighbor has a filter and still gets stains. Why?',
    a: 'Usually the system was a plain softener or an undersized single tank, not gear matched to the real iron level. Iron heavy enough to stain will overwhelm a system that was never sized for it. We test first, then build the system around your numbers. That is the difference between managing the iron and getting rid of it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How fast can a well system be installed in Walker?',
    a: 'Once your test is done and the system is picked, installation is usually a single visit at your well line. It is free with the system, and we check the iron and sulfur at your tap before we leave.',

          <p className="mt-7 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            Between Walker, Watson, and Holden, most homes sit outside any city water
            system and pull from private wells. USGS groundwater studies of Livingston
            Parish keep finding iron and manganese above the recommended limits in the
            local aquifers. That is the orange ring in your tub and the dark streaks in
            your washer. It will not clear up on its own, because it is in the ground
            itself.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            That rotten-egg smell rides along in many of the same wells. It is a sulfur
            gas. It is usually harmless, but it is hard to live with once it takes over
            a hot shower. The good news: both problems are fully treatable. The right
            system turns the iron and sulfur into bits a filter can catch, sized to the
            numbers from your well. Put it at the well line and the smell and stains
            leave every tap at once.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            Walker grew fast, so plenty of newer subdivisions mix well homes and
            city-water homes street by street. Not sure which one you have? The free
            test answers that too, along with exactly what is in your water either way.
