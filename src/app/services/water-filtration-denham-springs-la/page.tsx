  {
    q: 'Why does Denham Springs water turn brown sometimes?',
    a: 'The brown color comes from iron and manganese in parts of the parish water systems. Grit gets stirred up too, when a line breaks, a hydrant gets flushed, or the pressure changes. Local TV news has covered brown-water complaints in Denham Springs for years. Parts of Livingston Parish have also had boil advisories, including one near Juban Road in December 2024. None of that is your own plumbing failing. It is what shows up at your meter on a bad day.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will a filter actually fix brown water?',
    a: 'Yes. A whole-house system filters grit and iron right where the water enters your home. It catches the brown color before it reaches your faucets, laundry, and water heater. It cannot fix the city pipes themselves, so think of it as insurance. On the days the supply runs dirty, your house does not. Every tap stays clear because the filter sits at the main line, not under one sink.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does a filtration system cost in Denham Springs?',
    a: 'The Complete Home Package is $4,599 installed. Buying each system on its own costs more, so the package can save you up to 40%. Many Denham Springs homes need less than the full package. That is why the free in-home water test comes first. We quote the one system your water actually needs, and installation is free either way.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you serve all of Livingston Parish?',
    a: 'Yes. Denham Springs, Watson, Walker, Holden, and the roads between them are all core service area. Homes on city water usually need a filter like the ones on this page. Well homes toward Watson and Walker usually need iron and sulfur treatment instead. The free water test settles which type your home is before anyone quotes gear.',

            For years, Denham Springs folks have taken photos of brown tap water for
            the local news. That coverage is easy to find. Parts of the parish water
            systems have known iron and manganese problems. Those are the two minerals
            that stain water brown. Livingston Parish has also had boil advisories,
            including one near Juban Road in December 2024. When a line breaks or a
            hydrant gets flushed, the grit sitting in those pipes ends up in
            someone&apos;s laundry.

          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            We are not here to tell you your water is dangerous. It gets treated and
            checked. Most days it runs clear. But most days is not every day. Maybe
            you have filled a tub the color of tea. Maybe you have washed a load of
            whites twice. Maybe you have wondered if today is a bad day to make ice.
            If so, you feel that gap. A whole-house filter is what closes it.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
            A filter at your main line cleans every drop coming into the house. It
            catches grit before it settles in your water heater. It pulls out iron and
            manganese before they stain your sinks and tub. And it takes the chlorine
            taste and smell out of every tap. Out toward Juban Crossing and Watson, a
            lot of homes run on private wells instead of city water. Those homes
            usually need well treatment, and the free test tells you which kind of
            home you have.
