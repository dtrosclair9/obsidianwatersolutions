    a: 'Our Complete Home Package is $4,599 installed. Package pricing can save you up to 40% versus buying each piece apart. Installation is free with your system. And every quote starts with a free in-home water test, so the gear matches what is actually in your water. You see the full price before anything is scheduled.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does a whole house filter actually remove?',
    a: 'It removes the chlorine taste and smell, grit, and the fine bits that wear on your plumbing and appliances. City water arrives with chlorine added to keep it safe in the pipes. That does its job in the pipes, but it has no place in your coffee or your shower. A carbon filter at your main line pulls the chlorine taste and smell out. A grit filter catches the fine particles that old pipes can shed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is Baton Rouge tap water safe to drink?',
    a: 'The city cleans your water to meet the legal minimum, but the minimum is a floor, not a goal. Meeting a standard is not the same as reaching your glass clean. You cannot see the chlorine added to keep it safe. You cannot see the grit the old pipes shed. And you cannot see what your own older pipes add on the way to the tap. The only way to know what is really in your water is to test it. The in-home test is free.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What maintenance does a whole house system need?',
    a: 'Very little, and we walk you through all of it at the install. The filter lasts for years before it needs attention. The grit pre-filter is a simple swap now and then. Your system carries a lifetime warranty, and we are a phone call away for questions or checkups after.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does installation take?',
    a: 'Most whole house systems go in on a single visit, and we set the schedule when we quote the system. Installation is free and happens at your main water line. So every tap in the house is filtered once the system is in.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I get a whole house filter or an under-sink filter?',
    a: 'It depends on what you want to clean: one faucet, or the whole home. An under-sink system like reverse osmosis gives you great drinking water at the kitchen sink. But it does nothing for your showers, laundry, or water heater. A whole house filter cleans every drop that enters the home. Many Baton Rouge homes run both: a whole house filter for the home, and reverse osmosis for the glass.',

            The city cleans your water just enough to make it safe in the pipes. It
            is not cleaned to taste good or to reach you untouched. To keep it safe,
            the city adds chlorine, which leaves a taste and smell behind. From
            there the water runs through miles of old public pipes. The last stretch
            is the pipes inside your own home. You cannot see what it picks up along
            the way. Whole house filtration is built for exactly that.

                The chlorine that keeps water safe in the pipes has no place in your
                morning coffee or your shower steam. It carries a taste and smell
                most homes want gone. A carbon filter at your main line pulls it out.
                That means cleaner water for your glass, your coffee maker, and the
                steam you breathe in the shower.

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
                Old public pipes and the odd water-main break push fine grit into
                your plumbing. It clogs faucet screens and settles in your water
                heater. In older homes, the pipes on your own property can add to it.
                A filter catches this grit where the water enters your home, not
                inside your faucets.

                Your water heater, dishwasher, washing machine, and ice maker all
                last longer on filtered water. Each one costs real money to replace.
                And each one runs on whatever comes through your main line. Filter
                the line once, and everything downstream is better off.

                A whole house filter goes in at your main line. It cleans every drop

                garden hose the kids drink from in July. This is the right tool for
                chlorine, grit, and appliance protection. Those problems hit the whole
                house, not just one faucet.

                A filter under one sink, like reverse osmosis, cleans only that
                faucet. But it cleans it to a higher level than any whole house filter
                can. The kitchen sink is where that matters most: drinking, cooking,
                and coffee. The two work as a team, not rivals, and plenty of homes
                use both.
